# 11-Google-search-v2.1

Here, we go one step further from the previous example. Before `for` loop of `Google` function, a timeout value is initialized. And in the loop, everything is the same as the previous example but until timeout occurs. When it occurs, program returns.

So, if the search lasts too long, the program ends.
